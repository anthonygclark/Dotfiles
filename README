Collection of configurations for *nix. 

The installer script will look for the user's current version
of my dotfiles, back them up into a tarball, then install my 
dotfiles. If you answer `y` to make these generic, a patch
will be applied removing all of my user information/paths
from the files.

If you don't want my version of, for example, `.xinitrc`, after
a `git pull` or `git clone`, just remove this file from the place
where you pulled this source. The installer can't install something
that isn't there ;)
